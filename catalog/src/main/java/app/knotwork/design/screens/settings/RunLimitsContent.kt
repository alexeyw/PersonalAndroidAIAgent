/**
 * The run-limits screen: every ceiling one autonomous run is held to, plus the
 * one axis the app deliberately does not measure.
 *
 * Stateless, like every other settings surface in this module — the host
 * resolves the copy and owns the values.
 *
 * The screen exists because the limits shipped before any way to see them: the
 * engine has been stopping runs against four numbers of which exactly one was
 * visible, and the only prose about it inside the app promised a pause that
 * never happens.
 *
 * @param state Values, copy and states to render.
 * @param callbacks Value-change handlers.
 * @param modifier Optional layout modifier.
 * @param onBack Invoked by the scaffold's back affordance.

/**
 * One configurable limit: a labelled slider with an explanation and, when the
 * value is not independently set, a qualifier saying so.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** [KnotworkParamSlider] with extra parameters. Two things
 * this row needs are load-bearing here and absent there: a description (without
 * one, the only prose about a limit lived in the settings-search index, where
 * it went stale unnoticed) and a state qualifier.
 *
 * The title, qualifier and value share a [FlowRow] rather than a `Row`. That is
 * the whole reason this component exists rather than a wider `Row`: at a 200 %
 * font scale "Steps per background run" and its qualifier cannot both fit one
 * line, and a `Row` resolves that by clipping the qualifier off the screen
 * edge. Wrapping keeps every part readable at every scale.
 *
 * @param state Copy, value and range for this row.
 * @param onValueChange Invoked on every frame of a drag; move the displayed
 *   value, do not persist from here.
 * @param onValueChangeFinished Invoked once the gesture ends. This is the
 *   commit point, and the distinction is load-bearing for the inherited rows:
 *   persisting a background limit is what stops it following the interactive
 *   one, so it must happen when the user decides, not when they touch.
