/**
 * A dialog that asks for exactly one non-blank string.
 *
 * Renaming a preset and naming a pipeline are the same interaction, and they
 * were two components until this one replaced both. That mattered less for the
 * duplication than for what the duplication hid: one of the two had a baseline
 * and the other did not, so the same shape was verified in one place and
 * unverified in the other.
 *
 * The dialog owns its field state, because a text field that round-trips every
 * keystroke through the caller is the shape that makes typing feel laggy.
 * Confirm is gated on a non-blank, trimmed value — a rule the callers all had
 * separately and now cannot disagree about.
 *
 * @param ui Resolved copy and the initial value.
 * @param onDismiss Cancel or scrim tap.
 * @param onConfirm Confirmed, with the value as typed (untrimmed: the host owns
 *   what trimming means for its own field).
 * @param modifier Optional layout modifier applied to the dialog.

/**
 * The dialog's body, without the `AlertDialog` around it.

 * Split because a text field inside an `AlertDialog` never lets the Robolectric
 * harness reach idle — `setContent` spins until Espresso raises
 * `AppNotIdleException`. Measured against the v2 compose rule and against a
 * clock frozen before `setContent`; neither helps, because the host is what
 * never settles rather than the field. `NodeConfigSheet` carries a body for the
 * same class of reason, `ModalBottomSheet` being the host there.
 *
 * @param ui Resolved copy.
 * @param value Current field value.
 * @param onValueChange The field was edited.
 * @param modifier Optional layout modifier.
