# Architecture

This document is a developer-facing overview of the On-Device AI Agent for
Android. It is intended for contributors and external readers who want to
understand the shape of the codebase without reading every file. For
end-user guidance, see [`docs/user-guide.md`](user-guide.md); for recipes
on adding new functionality, see [`docs/extending.md`](extending.md).

All diagrams below are written in [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) and
render natively in GitHub markdown — no external tooling required.

---

## 1. Clean Architecture overview

The codebase is split into three Gradle modules:

```
:app        — Android application; hosts presentation / domain / data layers
:catalog    — Knotwork design-system Android library (theme, tokens, components)
:tools-probe — Debug-only companion app for the AppFunctions end-to-end test
```

Inside `:app`, the source tree is split into the three Clean Architecture
layers under `app/src/main/java/app/knotwork/android/`:

```
app/
├── presentation/   # Jetpack Compose UI, ViewModels (MVVM)
├── domain/         # Use cases, agent logic, tool abstractions, models
└── data/           # Repository implementations, engines, I/O, services
```

Dependencies flow strictly inward — `data` and `presentation` both depend
on `domain`, but `domain` depends on nothing else in the project. The
`domain` layer contains zero Android-framework imports (`android.*`,
`androidx.*`) and is pure Kotlin plus Coroutines.

`:catalog` is a leaf module: it exports `KnotworkTheme` and design-system
primitives, and depends on Compose only. `:app` consumes it as an
`implementation` dependency from the presentation layer; no domain or
data code is allowed to reference `:catalog`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph App[":app"]
        Presentation[presentation/<br/>Compose · ViewModels]
        Domain[domain/<br/>UseCases · Engine · Models · Repositories - interfaces]
        Data[data/<br/>Repositories - impl · LiteRT · Room · MCP · Services]
    end
    Catalog[":catalog<br/>Knotwork theme · tokens · components"]

    Presentation -->|depends on| Domain
    Data -->|implements| Domain
    Presentation -->|consumes| Catalog
```

Each layer maps onto concrete packages:

| Layer          | Packages                                                                                          |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `presentation` | `presentation/ui/{about,chat,files,memory,models,monitoring,more,onboarding,orchestrator,pipeline/editor,prompts,settings,splash,taskmonitor,tools}`, `presentation/ui/navigation`, `presentation/{components,state,theme,notifications,receivers}` |
| `domain`       | `domain/{usecases,engine,models,repositories,prompt,constants,services,pipelineio,promptio,memoryio}` |
| `data`         | `data/{engine,local,repositories,prompt,mcp,services,tools,network,mappers,logging}`              |

Cross-layer wiring is handled by **Hilt**. Modules in `di/` provide
external dependencies (Room, Retrofit, LiteRT, prompt-variable providers,
local-tool executors) and bind data-layer implementations to domain-layer
interfaces.

### 1.1. App shell and navigation

The presentation layer is hosted by a single `NavHost` declared in
`presentation/ui/navigation/AppNavGraph.kt`. The graph wires:

- **Splash** → **Onboarding** (only when `SettingsRepository.isFirstLaunch`
  is `true`) → **Chat tab**. After onboarding, the flag is persisted as
  `false` so subsequent launches go straight to Chat.
- Four top-level **tabs** rendered by `AppShellScaffold`'s Material3
  `NavigationBar` (decisions.md §12): **Chat / Pipelines / Tools / More**.
  Tab state — back-stack, scroll position, ViewModel state — is preserved
  across switches and rotations using the canonical
  `popUpTo(startDestination) { saveState = true } + restoreState = true`
  pattern.
- **Secondary destinations** live as additional `composable(...)` entries
  reachable from inside a tab. The pipelines tab is a nested `navigation { }`
  graph so the library and editor share a single `OrchestratorViewModel`
  scoped to the graph entry. The More tab is the umbrella for Memory,
  Models, Prompt library, Active tasks, Live metrics, Settings, and
  About.
- **Modal sheets** (`NodeConfigSheet`, `ConsolePane`, `AddMcpServerScreen`)
  share a single `KnotworkModalRoute` wrapper that combines Material3
  `ModalBottomSheet` with `PredictiveBackHandler` so Android 14+
  predictive-back animates the sheet in lockstep with the user's drag.
- Deep-links: `knotwork://chat/{threadId}` resolves to the parameterised
  `chat/{threadId}` route, forwarding the thread id to `ChatHomeViewModel.switchSession`.

Bottom-nav visibility per route is decided by the pure
`shouldShowBottomNav(route)` function (`BottomNavVisibility.kt`) — the
bar is hidden on Splash, Onboarding, Pipeline editor (full-screen
canvas), and any `sheet/...` route. While the user is on a tab's
start-destination, `BackHandler` short-circuits the system Back gesture
to `activity.finish()` so Back exits the app rather than switching tabs.

---

## 2. Data flow — life of a user message

The most common code path in the app is: the user types a message in the
chat screen and receives an agent response. The diagram below shows the
key actors and the order in which they collaborate.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor User
    participant UI as ChatHomeScreen<br/>(Compose)
    participant VM as ChatHomeViewModel
    participant UC as AgentOrchestratorUseCase
    participant Engine as GraphExecutionEngine
    participant Ctx as NodeContextBuilder
    participant Exec as NodeExecutor
    participant LLM as LiteRtRepository /<br/>CloudLlmProvider
    participant Repo as ChatRepository<br/>(Room + SQLCipher)

    User->>UI: types message
    UI->>VM: sendMessage(text)
    VM->>Repo: save user ChatMessage (isFinal = true)
    VM->>UC: invoke(text, sessionId)
    UC->>Engine: execute(pipelineGraph, executionContext)
    loop For each node in topological order
        Engine->>Ctx: build(input, NodeContextConfig)
        Ctx-->>Engine: assembled prompt
        Engine->>Exec: execute(node, assembledInput)
        Exec->>LLM: generate(prompt) / call tool
        LLM-->>Exec: Flow<String> tokens / ToolResult
        Exec-->>Engine: NodeOutput.State (console events)
        Engine-->>VM: AgentOrchestratorState (consoleLines)
    end
    Exec-->>Engine: NodeOutput.Result (final text)
    Engine-->>UC: result
    UC->>Repo: save agent ChatMessage (isFinal = true)
    Repo-->>VM: Flow<List<ChatMessage>> emission
    VM-->>UI: ChatHomeUiState (StateFlow)
    UI-->>User: rendered reply
```

Step-by-step notes:

1. The Compose layer is **stateless with respect to data** — `ChatHomeScreen`
   only observes `ChatHomeUiState` (a `StateFlow`) and forwards user input
   to `ChatHomeViewModel`. There are no direct repository or use-case calls
   from any `@Composable`.
2. `ChatHomeViewModel.sendMessage(...)` persists the user message first
   (so it survives crashes), then launches the agent on
   `viewModelScope`.
3. `AgentOrchestratorUseCase` resolves the pipeline bound to the active
   chat session (or the default one if the binding is `null`) and asks
   `GraphExecutionEngine` to run the graph.
4. `GraphExecutionEngine` walks the graph in topological order. For
   every node, it consults `NodeContextBuilder` to assemble the input
   prompt out of the blocks selected by the node's `NodeContextConfig`
   (see §3.2).
5. The matching `NodeExecutor` (one per `NodeType`, registered via Hilt
   multibinding) runs the node. Long-running nodes (`LITE_RT`, `CLOUD`)
   emit token-streaming and progress events as `NodeOutput.State`
   values; the terminal `NodeOutput.Result` carries the node's textual
   output to the engine.
6. While the graph executes, the engine emits
   `AgentOrchestratorState.ConsoleLog` events. The view-model folds
   them into the `consoleLines` flow exposed by `ChatHomeViewModel`,
   which `ChatHomeScreen` renders inside the dedicated console
   `ModalBottomSheet` overlay (opened from the agent-status pill above
   the composer). The console pane is **independent of the chat state
   machine** — it stays mounted across `Generating → HitlConfirm →
   Clarification` transitions instead of being a sealed `ChatHomeUiState`
   variant.
7. Intermediate node outputs are persisted with `isFinal = false`. The
   main message list filters those out via
   `ChatRepository.getDisplayMessagesForSession(...)`, but they remain
   available for debugging and export paths.
8. The final agent reply (`isFinal = true`) is saved through the
   repository; the resulting `Flow` emission updates the `messages` flow
   exposed by `ChatHomeViewModel` and the UI re-composes.
9. On the terminal `Completed` state, `ChatHomeViewModel` notifies the
   app-scoped `MemoryAutoExtractionCoordinator` (domain service). After a
   30-second per-session debounce — and only when
   `SettingsRepository.autoExtractEnabled` is set — it runs
   `MemoryExtractionUseCase`, which makes one local-model pass to distil
   durable facts from the recent dialogue, embeds them with the active
   `EmbeddingProvider`, drops near-duplicates, and writes survivors to
   `memory_chunks` tagged with `MemorySource.ChatSession`. This is
   fire-and-forget background work and never blocks or fails the chat.

### 2.1. Memory export / import and lazy re-embedding

Long-term memory is portable between devices. The `domain/memoryio`
gateway (`MemoryJsonSerializer`) serialises `memory_chunks` to a
`schemaVersion: 1` JSON document — stamped with the active
`embeddingProviderId` and an `exportedAt` timestamp — driven from
**Settings → Memory → Export** through a SAF stream
(`ExportMemoryBaseUseCase`). The provenance field reuses
`MemorySourceJson`, the same codec the Room `source` column converter
uses, so the on-disk encoding and the column stay identical.

Import (`MemoryImportUseCase`) parses the file (`Success` /
`SchemaMismatch` / `Failure`) and reconciles it under a user-chosen
strategy: **Merge** (insert only ids not already present) or **Replace**
(an atomic wipe-and-load, a no-op when the document carries no chunks),
preserving each chunk's id, provenance, pin state and tags. The parser
rejects chunks with a malformed embedding (empty array / non-finite
value) so a corrupt vector never reaches the store.

When the document's embedding provider differs from the importing
device's active **resolved** provider — `EmbeddingProviderResolver.resolve()`,
which accounts for the on-device fallback when the selected provider is
unavailable and is the same provider retrieval embeds queries with, not
the raw persisted setting — the inserted vectors live in an incompatible
space, so each chunk is flagged `needsReembedding` and the import
schedules a background pass through the `MemoryReembedScheduler` domain
seam (`APPEND_OR_REPLACE` so a second import always chains a fresh drain
rather than being coalesced away while a pass runs). `MemoryReembedWorker`
(a WorkManager `@HiltWorker`, mirroring `MemoryCompactionWorker`) then runs
`RecomputePendingEmbeddingsUseCase` off the hot path — re-embedding the
pending chunks in bounded batches (so a multi-thousand-chunk import neither
issues one oversized request nor loses progress on a mid-corpus failure)
and clearing the flag — with WorkManager retry/backoff if the provider is
temporarily unavailable. Retrieval never blocks on this; it simply
tolerates the not-yet-repaired chunks (whose cross-space vectors score ~0)
until the worker finishes. As a safety net for a one-off pass that was lost
(process killed before the enqueue persisted) or exhausted its retries,
`MainActivity` re-arms the worker on cold start whenever
`countMemoriesNeedingReembedding()` is non-zero. The manual *Settings →
Memory → Re-embed* action shares the same flag-clearing write so the two
repair paths converge.

### 2.2. Long-term memory lifecycle

Long-term memory is a vector store (`memory_chunks`) of durable facts
distilled from past conversations. The diagram below traces one fact from
the message that states it, through storage, to the moment a *later*
session retrieves it into a node's prompt — plus the background compaction
loop that keeps the table dense. Only the on-device LLM and the embedding
backend are model-dependent; everything else is plain domain code.

```mermaid
flowchart TB

    end

        Cluster --> Consolidate[LLM consolidates clusters ≥ 3<br/>→ MemorySource.Compaction<br/>pinned chunks exempt]
        Consolidate --> Store
    end
```

Key invariants:

1. **One retrieval per run.** The engine memoises memory off the immutable
   `userPrompt`, so multiple memory-enabled nodes in a graph share a single
   embed + search rather than re-querying per node.
2. **Same embedding space.** Both extraction and retrieval resolve the
   *active* provider via `EmbeddingProviderResolver`, so a query is always
   embedded with whatever produced the stored vectors; a mismatch (e.g. a
   chunk imported under a different provider) scores ~0 until re-embedded
   (see §2.1).
3. **Pinned is sacred.** Pinned chunks bypass the recency decay and
   threshold filter on retrieval and are never compaction candidates — the
   one mechanism a user has to guarantee a fact stays findable.
4. **Age never hides a fact.** `findSimilarMemories` scans the *entire*
   `memory_chunks` table on every query — there is no recency window on
   visibility. Recency only *weights* candidates inside `MemoryReranker`'s
   half-life decay, and the same full-pool rule applies to the extraction
   dedup check. The pool stays bounded by the compaction hard-limit
   (`maxMemoryChunks`), which is the explicit performance cap.

The on-device write path is covered end-to-end by the instrumented
`MemoryLifecycleIntegrationTest` (extract → retrieve into the context block
→ survive a compaction pass over a real Room database).

## 3. Pipeline engine

Pipelines are first-class. A `PipelineGraph` is a directed graph of typed
`NodeModel` values connected by `ConnectionModel` edges. The engine that
runs them is `GraphExecutionEngine`, decomposed into per-type
`NodeExecutor` strategies.

### 3.1. Node types

| `NodeType`         | Purpose                                                                                       |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `INPUT`            | Entry point. Echoes the user's original message downstream. Exactly one per graph.            |
| `LITE_RT`          | On-device LLM call via LiteRT-LM. Streams tokens as `Flow<String>`.                           |
| `CLOUD`            | Cloud LLM call. Provider (OpenAI / Anthropic / Google / DeepSeek / Ollama) selected by param. |
| `OUTPUT`           | Final answer to the user. Optionally wraps upstream text with a system prompt.                |
| `SUMMARY`          | Condenses tool results / multi-turn output into a single message.                             |
| `INTENT_ROUTER`    | Routes execution down one branch based on classified intent.                                  |
| `DECOMPOSITION`    | Splits a complex task into ordered subtasks; feeds them into a downstream queue.              |
| `EVALUATION`       | Scores or critiques an intermediate result; can short-circuit the graph.                      |
| `CLARIFICATION`    | Asks the user a follow-up question and suspends the pipeline until they answer.               |
| `TOOL`             | Invokes an AppFunctions or MCP tool. Gated by `ToolRisk` (see §4.2).                          |
| `IF_CONDITION`     | Boolean branch on a condition evaluated against the running context.                          |
| `QUEUE_PROCESSOR`  | Drains the priority task queue produced by `DECOMPOSITION`, one item per iteration.           |

### 3.2. `NodeContextBuilder` and the fixed block order

Every node receives an **assembled input**, not the raw text of the
previous node. `NodeContextBuilder` is the single source of truth for
that format. Each enabled block is wrapped in a `--- <Block Name> ---`
header; blocks are concatenated in this **fixed order** regardless of
which subset is enabled:

1. `--- Original Task ---` — the user message that started the current
   run.
2. `--- Chat History ---` — numbered conversation history with
   `USER`/`AGENT` roles.
3. `--- Long-Term Memory ---` — semantic-retrieval hits over past
   memory chunks. A vector search ranks chunks by cosine similarity;
   `MemoryReranker` then re-scores the pool (recency decay, a pinned
   boost, near-duplicate collapse, and a final-score threshold) before
   the top-K hits are injected.
4. `--- Tool Results ---` — outputs of every tool invocation made
   during the current run.
5. `--- Previous Node Output ---` — the text produced by the
   immediately upstream node.

The order is **not** an implementation detail. It is fixed for two
reasons:

- **Prompt cache stability.** Downstream LLMs (Anthropic, OpenAI, the
  local LiteRT runtime) hash the prefix to reuse cache. Reordering
  blocks between runs would invalidate that cache.
- **Position sensitivity.** LLMs respond best when the payload of the
  current iteration sits closest to the generation point, so
  `Previous Node Output` is always last.

An enabled block with no data does not produce an empty header — the
block is simply skipped. If no enabled block has content, the builder
returns an empty string.

### 3.3. `NodeContextConfig` flags

`NodeContextConfig` is a data class of five booleans, one per block:

| Flag             | Includes                                                                     |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `originalTask`   | The user message that started the current pipeline run.                      |
| `chatHistory`    | Numbered messages from the active chat session (`USER` / `AGENT`).           |
| `longTermMemory` | Memory chunks retrieved by semantic search against the original task.        |
| `toolResults`    | All `toolName: output` snapshots accumulated during this run.                |
| `nodeInput`      | The text produced by the previous node in the chain.                         |

Recommended defaults per node type (`NodeContextConfig.defaultForType`):

- `INPUT`, `IF_CONDITION` → `nodeInput` only (control flow).
- `LITE_RT`, `CLARIFICATION`, `QUEUE_PROCESSOR`, `DECOMPOSITION`
  → `nodeInput + originalTask` (minimum context for a small model).
- `CLOUD`, `INTENT_ROUTER` → `nodeInput + originalTask + chatHistory`
  (large context window, history is cheap).
- `TOOL` → `nodeInput` only (the tool just needs its arguments).
- `SUMMARY`, `EVALUATION`
  → `nodeInput + originalTask + toolResults` (aggregation).
- `OUTPUT` → all five flags (final answer should see everything).

### 3.4. Validation rules

`PipelineGraph.validate()` enforces graph-level invariants before the
engine accepts a graph for execution:

- Exactly one `INPUT` node and at least one `OUTPUT` node.
- No cycles; the graph must be a DAG.
- Every connection refers to existing source and target node ids.
- Nodes for which `NodeModel.usesContextConfig() == true` must have at
  least one flag enabled — an empty config would feed the executor
  nothing to work with.
- Nodes that ignore the config (`INPUT`, `IF_CONDITION`,
  `QUEUE_PROCESSOR`, and `OUTPUT` when it has no `systemPrompt`) are
  exempt from the empty-config rule — they always forward upstream
  text verbatim.

System prompts on LLM-driven nodes can contain `$KEY` placeholders. The
`PromptTemplateEngine` substitutes them on every render via Hilt-bound
`PromptVariableProvider` instances. Built-in keys: `$DATE`, `$TIME`,
`$TOOLS`, `$MODEL`, `$MEMORY_SUMMARY`, `$LANG`, `$LOCATION`, `$USER`,
`$DEVICE`. Unknown placeholders are kept
verbatim and logged as a warning. See
[`docs/extending.md`](extending.md) for the recipe to add new
variables.

## 4. Integrations

### 4.1. LiteRT-LM (on-device inference)

`LiteRtRepository` is the contract between the agent and the on-device
model:

```kotlin
interface LiteRtRepository {
    suspend fun loadModel(modelPath: String): Result<Unit>
    fun generate(prompt: String): Flow<String>
    suspend fun unloadModel()
    val isModelLoaded: StateFlow<Boolean>
}
```

Rules the implementation guarantees:

- Model loading runs on `Dispatchers.IO` inside a coroutine. The native
  handle is held by a `ModelSession` wrapper.
- Inference is exposed as a **token-streaming** `Flow<String>` — UI and
  the orchestrator can render partial output as it arrives.
- A `Mutex` gates inference. Concurrent calls to `generate(...)` are
  serialized so the native session is never accessed from two
  coroutines at once.
- `ModelSession.close()` is called from `ViewModel.onCleared()` and
  from the foreground service's `onDestroy()` to release native memory
  and avoid OOM.
- Memory usage is logged with `Timber.d` before and after model load
  so that regressions show up immediately in logcat.

### 4.2. AppFunctions Jetpack (tool calling)

The agent talks to AppFunctions in two directions:

- **Caller-side** — the agent invokes AppFunctions exposed by *other*
  apps. `LocalAppFunctionManager` discovers them through
  `AppFunctionManager.observeAppFunctions(...)` and `ToolRepositoryImpl`
  merges the result into the visible tool catalogue (alongside built-ins
  and MCP tools). AppFunctions are keyed by their qualified name
  (`"${packageName}/${id}"`) so identical ids exposed by different
  packages can coexist. Dispatch goes through
  `LocalAppFunctionManager.invokeByName(...)`, which encodes arguments via
  `AppFunctionDataCodec`, calls
  `AppFunctionManager.executeAppFunction(...)`, and renders the response
  back into a flat JSON string for the agent's observation log. There is
  no longer any `intentionally not included` gating — discovered
  AppFunctions are first-class tools.
- **Callee-side** — the agent exposes a curated set of read-only
  built-ins to *other* apps. Wrappers live in
  `data/tools/local/appfunctions/` and are annotated with
  `androidx.appfunctions.service.AppFunction`. The auto-merged
  `androidx.appfunctions.service.PlatformAppFunctionService` (from
  `appfunctions-service`) advertises them through
  `app_functions_v2.xml` (generated by KSP with the
  `appfunctions:aggregateAppFunctions=true` arg in `app/build.gradle.kts`)
  and dispatches incoming requests through KSP-generated invokers.
  `App` implements
  `androidx.appfunctions.service.AppFunctionConfiguration.Provider` to
  supply Hilt-managed instances of those wrappers, so the callee path
  shares caches and rate limits with the caller path. The first wrapper
  is `SearchAppFunction`, a thin shell over the built-in `search_tool`
  (READ_ONLY). `schedule_task` and `delegate_task` are intentionally
  **not** exposed: scheduling a `WorkManager` job or burning the user's
  cloud API quota on behalf of a third-party caller would violate the
  user's expectation of agency.

Caveat: when a wrapper's package path contains a Kotlin soft keyword
(`data`, `value`, …), the AppFunctions compiler bakes Kotlin
source-level escaping into the generated wire id. `SearchAppFunction`'s
id therefore embeds literal backticks around `data`:
`` app.knotwork.android.`data`.tools.local.appfunctions.SearchAppFunction#invoke ``
External callers must pass the backticks verbatim. The
end-to-end test (`AppFunctionsEndToEndTest.SEARCH_TOOL_ID`) and the
`:tools-probe` `MainActivity` constant are the source-of-truth literals.

Every tool — built-in, discovered AppFunction, or MCP — carries an
effective
[`ToolRisk`](../app/src/main/java/app/knotwork/android/domain/models/ToolRisk.kt):

```kotlin
enum class ToolRisk { READ_ONLY, SENSITIVE, DESTRUCTIVE }
```

`AgentTool.risk` is informational on the model itself. The single source
of truth for HITL decisions is `ToolRepository.getRisk(name)`, which
merges three layers:

1. **Built-in tools** carry hard-coded constants set in
   `ToolRepositoryImpl.getBuiltinTools()`: `search_tool` → `READ_ONLY`,
   `schedule_task` → `SENSITIVE`, `delegate_task` → `SENSITIVE`.
2. **Discovered AppFunctions** (from `LocalAppFunctionManager`) default
   to `SENSITIVE` because the platform `AppFunctionManager` metadata
   gives no trustworthy signal about side effects. Users can override
   per-tool through
   `SettingsRepository.setAppFunctionRiskOverride(toolName, risk)`,
   which writes into the `appFunctionRiskOverrides` flow persisted
   under DataStore key `app_function_risk_overrides`. The override
   always wins over the conservative default.
3. **MCP tools** are blanket `SENSITIVE` until a per-server policy
   scheme is introduced.

HITL contract (live):

- Before dispatching a tool, `ToolNodeExecutor` resolves the tool's risk
  through `ToolRepository.getRisk(name)` and applies the gate:
  - `SENSITIVE` and `DESTRUCTIVE` — always emit
    `AgentOrchestratorState.WaitingForApproval(toolName, args, risk)` and
    suspend on the per-session approval `CompletableDeferred` until the
    user resolves it via the chat console row, the system notification
    action, or the configured timeout.
  - `READ_ONLY` — run without a prompt **unless** the user has globally
    enabled `SettingsRepository.requiresUserConfirmation`. That flag is
    now an opt-in "ask on every single tool call" override and never
    silences `SENSITIVE` / `DESTRUCTIVE`.
- `WaitingForApproval` carries the resolved `risk` so the chat console
  can render a coloured risk chip (`READ` / `SENS` / `DEST`) next to the
  tool name without re-resolving.
- The notification fallback (`ApprovalNotificationManager`) uses two
  `IMPORTANCE_HIGH` channels: `AgentApprovalChannel` for `SENSITIVE` /
  opt-in `READ_ONLY` and `AgentApprovalDestructiveChannel` for
  `DESTRUCTIVE`, with distinct icon and title so the destructive prompt
  is recognisable at a glance in the system shade.

### 4.3. Model Context Protocol (MCP)

External tool servers are integrated through MCP clients in
`data/mcp/` (`KoogMcpClient`, `McpClient`). `ToolRepositoryImpl` holds
active connections in a `ConcurrentHashMap<String, McpClient>` keyed by
server id. Connections are **lazy**: they open on first use and close
when the agent session ends. Every MCP call is wrapped in
`runCatching` and converted to a `ToolResult.Error` on failure — raw
exceptions never reach the presentation layer.

### 4.4. Cloud LLM providers

Cloud providers (`openai`, `anthropic`, `google`, `deepseek`, `ollama`)
implement the `CloudLlmProvider` interface in `domain`. They are
dispatched by the single unified `CLOUD` node, which takes the
provider id as a parameter — there is no provider-specific node type,
and adding a new provider does not require touching the pipeline
engine. API keys live in the Keystore-backed encrypted store (see §5.2)
and are never serialized into DataStore or git.

### 4.5. File and HTTP tools (the workspace contour)

The agent has a private **workspace** — a single jailed directory
(`files/agent_workspace/`) behind the domain interface `AgentWorkspace`
(impl: `data/local/AgentWorkspaceImpl`) — plus an outbound `http_request`
tool. These are ordinary `LocalToolExecutor`s, so they flow through the same
`ToolRisk` → HITL machinery as every other tool (§4.2); what makes them a
distinct *contour* is that, in combination, they form a read-then-exfiltrate
path that the design deliberately constrains. The honest at-rest and
threat-model framing lives in [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md); this section
is the structural map.

The six file tools and their effective risk:

| Tool         | `ToolRisk`     | Touches                                              |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `read_file`  | `READ_ONLY`    | reads one text file (token-budget truncated)        |
| `list_files` | `READ_ONLY`    | path-sorted listing with size / mtime               |
| `find_files` | `READ_ONLY`    | glob search over relative paths                     |
| `write_file` | `SENSITIVE`    | atomic create / overwrite, quota-checked            |
| `edit_file`  | `SENSITIVE`    | unique-anchor find-replace in an existing file      |
| `delete_file`| `DESTRUCTIVE`  | irreversible single-file delete                     |
| `http_request` | `SENSITIVE` (GET) / `DESTRUCTIVE` (POST/PUT/DELETE) | outbound HTTP(S) to an allowlisted host |

Two integrity boundaries sit underneath the risk gate:

- **The canonicalisation gate.** Every relative path a file tool supplies is
  resolved through `AgentWorkspace.resolve` — the single canonicalisation
  point every other method funnels through — and checked for containment. A
  `../` traversal, an absolute path, or a symlink that escapes the directory
  is refused with a typed `WorkspaceError.PathOutsideWorkspace` before any I/O
  — a tool can only ever act inside the workspace. Size quotas
  (`WorkspaceError.TooLarge` / `QuotaExceeded`) are enforced in the same layer.
- **The HTTP allowlist gate.** `http_request` is published to the agent only
  when the user's allowed-domains allowlist is non-empty (Settings → Tools →
  Allowed domains, persisted in DataStore under `allowed_http_domains`). The
  per-call risk, the exact-host check, redirect re-validation, and the
  stored-credential filter all live in the pure `HttpRequestPolicy`, which
  both `ToolRepository.getRisk(name, arguments)` and the executor's own
  enforcement read from, so the gate and the actual refusal cannot diverge.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Untrusted["Untrusted input<br/>(imported file · tool result)"] --> Read[read_file<br/>READ_ONLY]
    Read --> Model[Model in a pipeline node]

    Allow -->|refused| Obs[ToolResult.Error<br/>→ observation log, run continues]
    WS -->|inside sandbox| Run
    WS -->|escapes / over quota| Obs
```

A refused tool call (path escape, quota exceeded, non-allowlisted host,
stored-key leak) never crashes the run: it maps to a `ToolResult.Error` that
lands in the observation log, and the pipeline keeps executing.

---

## 5. Persistence

### 5.1. Room

The local database (`AppDatabase`, `agent_database.db`) holds chat
sessions and messages, long-term memory chunks, local-model metadata,
pipelines (nodes and connections), prompt templates, pipeline-run
lifecycle records and the per-run execution trace. DAOs are split per
aggregate (`ChatDao`, `MemoryDao`, `PipelineDao`, …) and live under
`data/local/dao/`.

**Run trace (buffered write-through).** While the execution engine
walks a graph it appends every console event and every node's
input/output snapshot to the persistent run trace through the domain
interface `RunTraceRepository`. The Room-backed implementation
(`RunTraceRepositoryImpl`) never commits per event: records accumulate
in an in-memory buffer and reach `trace_steps` as a single batch insert
when the buffer fills (32 records) or a short timer elapses (500 ms),
so trace persistence does not compete with on-device inference for
disk I/O during token streaming. The engine force-flushes the buffer
at every suspension point (tool-approval and clarification waits) and
at the terminal point of the run — including cancellation — so the
persisted trace is complete whenever the run can pause, end, or the
process can be killed. Records carry a per-run monotonic sequence
number; the chat console replays the stored trace of a session's
active (or latest) run on open and merges live events on top by that
sequence, which keeps the replay/live seam free of duplicates. Trace
rows cascade-delete with their parent `pipeline_runs` row.

Migration rules:

- Schema migrations are explicit
  (`Migration(oldVersion, newVersion) { … }`) and registered through
  `addMigrations(...)` in `AppModule`. There is **no destructive fallback on
  upgrade**, so an in-place version bump preserves user data; a missing
  migration fails fast in development instead of silently dropping tables.
  Destructive recreation is retained only on **downgrade**
  (`fallbackToDestructiveMigrationOnDowngrade`), which forward migrations
  cannot handle. The migrations across the exported-schema baseline range are
  covered by a `MigrationTestHelper` regression suite.
- Auto-migrations are allowed for additive changes only.
- DAO methods returning `Flow<T>` are annotated with `@Query` — no
  ad-hoc reactive wrapping.
- Operations that touch multiple tables use `@Transaction`.
- `CoroutineDispatcher` is injected into data sources for
  testability; heavy I/O runs on `Dispatchers.IO`.

### 5.2. At-rest encryption

The Room database is encrypted at rest with **SQLCipher** via
`SupportOpenHelperFactory` from `net.zetetic:sqlcipher-android`.
Encryption applies to every table that may hold user-derived content:

- `chat_messages`, `chat_sessions` — user messages and LLM replies.
- `memory_chunks` — long-term memory fragments distilled from
  conversations.
- `trace_steps` — the persistent pipeline-run trace: per-node
  input/output snapshots and console log events, all derived from
  user input.
- `pipeline_runs` — run lifecycle records (status, current node,
  graph content hash, error message, the original user prompt).
- `pending_interactions` — parked background HITL requests: the staged
  tool name and arguments awaiting approval, or the clarification
  question awaiting an answer.

Secrets — the SQLCipher passphrase, per-provider cloud API keys, and
the HuggingFace access token —
live in **`KeystoreBackedPrefsStore`** instances (`data/local/crypto/`):
plain `SharedPreferences` files whose values are encrypted with
**AES-256-GCM under a dedicated, non-exportable Android Keystore key**
(`AndroidKeystoreAeadCipher` behind the `AeadCipher` boundary, framing
in `AesGcmCodec`). Each value is authenticated with associated data
derived from the store name and the entry key, so a ciphertext copied
between slots fails authentication instead of decrypting under the
wrong label. This replaced the deprecated `EncryptedSharedPreferences`
(and removed the `androidx.security:security-crypto` dependency): with
the data key living directly in the Keystore there is no intermediate
wrapped-keyset file left to corrupt, and opening a store can no longer
fail — failures move to individual value reads, where each consumer
applies its own recovery policy. The replacement shipped without a data
migration under the pre-release storage policy: pre-existing installs
go through the startup recovery screen (explicit wipe) and re-enter
their API keys.

The passphrase lifecycle is asymmetric by design
(`EncryptedDbPassphraseProvider`):

- A passphrase is **generated only while no database file exists yet**.
  Once a database is present it is never regenerated: any failure to read
  the stored value (missing or malformed entry, failed authenticated
  decryption) or a key/file mismatch detected at open time raises a typed
  `DbPassphraseUnavailableException` that routes to the startup recovery
  screen, where the user chooses between retrying and an explicitly
  confirmed wipe. Silent self-healing of the passphrase store is allowed
  only while no database exists, because then nothing can be orphaned.
- The passphrase is resolved **lazily at the first real database open**
  (`DeferredPassphraseOpenHelperFactory`), not during dependency injection,
  so a keystore failure surfaces where the UI can handle it; best-effort
  background maintenance skips its work instead of crashing while the
  recovery screen is up.
- The API-key store applies the opposite, availability-first policy: a
  value that no longer decrypts is dropped and reported as unset — keys
  are user re-enterable, so availability wins there.

Inside the encrypted database, `memory_chunks.embedding` is stored as a
**BLOB of little-endian IEEE-754 float32 values** (4 bytes per
component). `EmbeddingBlobCodec` converts between the binary column and
the in-memory `FloatArray` at the storage boundary; the memory
export/import JSON format is unaffected and keeps embeddings as plain
number arrays.

User-tunable settings (sampling parameters, timeouts, pipeline-step
bounds, default pipeline id, opt-in flags) live in **DataStore**, one
instance per feature module. DataStore is not encrypted — it is
explicitly reserved for non-sensitive preferences. Any value that is
sensitive (an API key, a passphrase, a personal identifier) goes
through a `KeystoreBackedPrefsStore` instead.

#### Storage tiers at a glance

The app keeps data in four tiers, each with a different at-rest posture.
The split is deliberate: structured user-derived rows get the app's own
cipher; secrets get the Keystore; non-sensitive knobs and bulk files rely on
the OS sandbox plus file-based encryption (FBE). The asymmetry between the
SQLCipher-encrypted database and the FBE-only workspace is called out
explicitly in [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) (*Agent file workspace*).

| Tier                          | What it holds                                                                                                  | At-rest protection                                                        |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Room DB** (`agent_database.db`) | `chat_messages`, `chat_sessions`, `memory_chunks`, `trace_steps`, `pipeline_runs`, `pending_interactions`, pipelines / presets / prompt templates | **SQLCipher** (full-database AES) under the app's Keystore-held passphrase |
| **Keystore-backed stores** (`KeystoreBackedPrefsStore`) | SQLCipher passphrase, cloud-provider API keys, HuggingFace access token                                        | **AES-256-GCM per value**, key non-exportable in the Android Keystore      |
| **DataStore** (Preferences)   | Non-sensitive settings: sampling params, timeouts, default pipeline id, opt-in flags, `allowed_http_domains`, `app_function_risk_overrides` | **FBE + app sandbox only** (plaintext within the sandbox; no app cipher)   |
| **Agent workspace** (`files/agent_workspace/`) | Agent-produced and user-imported files (reports, exports, inputs)                                              | **FBE + app sandbox only** — *not* SQLCipher-encrypted (see `SECURITY.md`) |

### 5.3. JSON parsing

Pipeline import/export and tool-argument parsing use
`kotlinx.serialization` or `org.json.JSONObject` only — no manual
string parsing. `JSONException`s are caught and converted to typed
result classes (`PipelineImportOutcome`, `ToolResult.Error`).

---

## 6. Background work

The agent must survive backgrounding without being killed by the
system, and it must release native model memory when it is genuinely
idle. Three components coordinate that lifecycle:

| Component                  | Responsibility                                                                                |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `AgentForegroundService`   | Keeps the process alive while a pipeline runs; shows a persistent notification.               |
| `AgentWorker` (WorkManager)| Executes deferred / scheduled tasks (driven by `ScheduleTaskUseCase`).                        |
| `AgentIdleManager`         | Watches device idle / Doze state and signals when the agent can safely unload the model.     |
| `AgentPowerManager`        | Watches charging and battery state; throttles or defers work on low battery.                  |
| `ScheduledTaskNotifier`    | Announces scheduled-run outcomes ("Task completed" / "Task failed") with a deep-link into the session. |
| `PendingInteractionMaintenanceWorker` | Periodic (6 h) expiry pass: fails runs whose parked approval / clarification outlived the approval window. |
| `RunRetentionWorker`       | Daily (charging + idle) retention pass over `pipeline_runs` / `trace_steps` — see *Run retention* below. |
| `MemoryCompactionWorker`   | Daily (charging + idle) long-term-memory compaction (see the memory lifecycle section).        |

A scheduled task is not a separate execution path: `AgentWorker`
enqueues the stored prompt through the same `TaskQueueManager` →
`GraphExecutionEngine` chain as an interactive message (with
`origin = SCHEDULER` on the persistent run record and normal — not
interactive — queue priority). Everything the engine persists for
interactive runs therefore lands identically for scheduled ones: the
user message, intermediate `isFinal = false` node messages, the final
answer, and the trace. The worker tracks completion through the
persistent `pipeline_runs` record (the in-memory state flow replays
stale terminal states and carries no run identity), promotes itself to
a foreground service via WorkManager's `setForeground()` for the
duration of inference (degrading gracefully when the OS forbids the
promotion from deep background), and — when the session the task was
bound to has been deleted — re-binds the run to a fresh auto-named
session. In a headless process (no activity, so no
`AgentForegroundService` and no `AgentIdleManager`) the worker unloads
the LLM engine itself once the run settles and no other session has an
active run.

The model-unload contract is non-negotiable: when the agent has been
inactive in the background for the configured idle window, the
foreground service triggers `LiteRtRepository.unloadModel()` to release
~hundreds of megabytes of native memory. The next user message
re-loads the model via `LoadModelUseCase`. This trade-off is
deliberate — a small cold-start cost is preferable to draining the
battery or starving other apps of RAM.

```mermaid

```

### 6.1. Pipeline run lifecycle

Every execution — interactive or scheduled — is backed by a persistent
record in `pipeline_runs`, written through `PipelineRunRepository` at
each lifecycle point. The record is what survives process death: the
in-memory state flow dies with the process, the row does not.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> QUEUED : enqueueTask
    QUEUED --> RUNNING : pipeline resolved,<br/>graph hash captured
    RUNNING --> WAITING_APPROVAL : HITL gate parked<br/>(live wait timed out)
    RUNNING --> WAITING_CLARIFICATION : clarification parked
    RUNNING --> COMPLETED : OUTPUT node reached
    RUNNING --> FAILED : node error
    RUNNING --> CANCELLED : user Stop
    RUNNING --> INTERRUPTED : process died<br/>(orphan sweep at next start)
    WAITING_APPROVAL --> QUEUED : decision recorded<br/>(checkpoint resume)
    WAITING_CLARIFICATION --> QUEUED : answer recorded<br/>(checkpoint resume)
    WAITING_APPROVAL --> FAILED : approval window expired
    WAITING_CLARIFICATION --> FAILED : approval window expired
    INTERRUPTED --> QUEUED : user taps Resume<br/>(within resume window)
    INTERRUPTED --> FAILED : user taps Discard
    COMPLETED --> [*]
    FAILED --> [*]
    CANCELLED --> [*]
```

Key invariants:

- **Terminal guard.** Every status write carries a SQL-level
  `status NOT IN (terminal)` guard, so a late writer can never flip a
  settled run back to an active state. The only sanctioned
  terminal-to-terminal transition is `INTERRUPTED → FAILED` (the user
  discarded the resume offer).
- **Orphan sweep.** On every cold start the app marks `INTERRUPTED`
  every non-terminal run that is not owned by the current process and
  not parked on a pending interaction — the in-memory machinery that
  could finish such a run died with its process.
- **Checkpoint resume.** A resumed run re-enters the queue as a
  resume-flagged task. The engine rebuilds a `ResumeContext` from the
  persisted trace and **replays** the recorded output of every node it
  already completed instead of re-executing it; the first node without
  a record continues live. `INPUT` and `OUTPUT` are re-executed (they
  are trivial / terminal), and a `TOOL` node is **never replayed** —
  it re-resolves its call and re-raises the HITL gate. The checkpoint
  is invalidated when the pipeline graph changed between interruption
  and resume (content-hash comparison) or when the run outlived the
  resume window; both cases only offer a full restart.
- **Nested run tree.** A `PIPELINE` node runs its callee as a
  first-class **child run** whose `pipeline_runs.parentRunId` points at
  the parent (a self-referential `ON DELETE CASCADE` foreign key, so
  retention of a root removes its whole sub-tree). The child run id is
  *deterministic* — `"<parentRunId>::<nodeId>::<visitIndex>"` — which is
  what lets resume continue the exact same child: the parent replays to
  its `PIPELINE` node (its `NodeIo` was never recorded because the node
  was in flight), recomputes the child id, and resumes the child run
  from its own trace rather than restarting it. The recorded graph hash
  is validated for every graph in the stack. Children are internal:
  session-level queries (reattach, status card, activity badge) filter
  to `parentRunId IS NULL`, and resume / park-settlement always act on
  the **root** of the tree (resolved by walking `parentRunId` up). A
  child's trace records carry a nesting `depth` so the console renders
  them indented under the spawning node. The `MAX_STEPS` budget is a
  single `RunStepBudget` threaded (via `ExecutionScope`) through the
  whole tree, so a sub-pipeline decrements the parent's allowance and
  exhaustion at any depth fails the entire stack.

### 6.2. Two-phase HITL (background approvals)

The human-in-the-loop gate on `SENSITIVE` / `DESTRUCTIVE` tools waits
in two phases:

1. **Live phase** — the run suspends on an in-process deferred; the
   chat card or the approval notification completes it. This is the
   only phase an interactive, foregrounded session normally sees.
2. **Persistent phase (park)** — when the live wait times out (the UI
   is gone, the user did not respond), the run **parks**: the staged
   tool name and arguments are written to `pending_interactions`, the
   run record settles into `WAITING_APPROVAL`, the engine flow ends
   without a terminal state, and the foreground service is free to
   stop. A high-importance notification stays actionable; approving or
   denying from it — even after process death — records the decision
   onto the parked record and resumes the run from its checkpoint, where
   the `TOOL` node consumes the decision under a TOCTOU guard (the
   re-resolved tool call must match the parked snapshot exactly).
   Clarifications park the same way, answered via a deep link into the
   chat. An unanswered park is failed by the maintenance pass once the
   user-configurable **approval window** (default 24 h) elapses.

### 6.3. Run retention

`pipeline_runs` and `trace_steps` grow with every execution and hold
content derived from user input, so a daily `RunRetentionWorker`
(charging + idle + battery-not-low, alongside memory compaction)
applies `CleanupPipelineRunsUseCase`: terminal runs beyond the **last N
per session** window or older than the **max age** are deleted, their
traces cascading via the `trace_steps.runId` foreign key; legacy trace
rows that predate run attribution are aged out by the same cutoff.
Both limits are user-tunable in **Settings → Privacy** (defaults: 20
runs per chat, 30 days). Non-terminal runs — including parked
`WAITING_*` runs — are never retention candidates; their lifetime is
bounded by the approval window instead (see above).
