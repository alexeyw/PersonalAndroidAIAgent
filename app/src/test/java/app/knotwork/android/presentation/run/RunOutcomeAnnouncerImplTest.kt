/**
 * Coverage for [RunOutcomeAnnouncerImpl] — the line a stopped run leaves in the
 * chat it ran in.
 *
 * The defect it exists to end: a run that failed while the app was in the
 * background reached the user only as ViewModel state, so returning to the chat
 * found the user's message and no reply at all. Two properties therefore matter
 * more than the wording — the line is **visible** (`isFinal = true`, which the
 * display query filters on), and it says the **same thing** every other surface
 * says about the same event.
