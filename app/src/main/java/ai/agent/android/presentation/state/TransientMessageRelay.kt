/**
 * Process-wide hot bus for one-shot user-visible messages that need to
 * survive a navigation event.
 *
 * Motivating case: the onboarding skip-flow emits a hint
 * (*"You can install a model from Settings → Models"*) but
 * `OnboardingScreen` pops itself off the back-stack the very same frame
 * the snackbar event would be collected, so a screen-local
 * `SnackbarHost` never gets a chance to render it. Routing the message
 * through this singleton lets any composable mounted at a stable level
 * (currently `MainActivity`) keep the host alive across navigation.
 *
 * The relay is intentionally minimal — a single `SharedFlow<String>`,
 * no severity / action / id metadata — because the only consumer today
 * is the activity-level snackbar host. If a second consumer surfaces
 * (e.g. a system-status banner), expand to a sealed `TransientMessage`
 * model rather than overloading this contract.

     *  - `BufferOverflow.DROP_OLDEST` — if a second message arrives
