/**
 * Builds a compact one-line preview of a [PipelineGraph] for the preset
 * picker card subtitle: e.g. `INPUT → LITE_RT → OUTPUT` or
 * `INPUT → INTENT_ROUTER → LITE_RT → OUTPUT`.
 *
 * The traversal is deliberately tolerant of malformed graphs — bundled
 * presets ship with topologically-valid graphs, but the helper is reused on
 * user-saved presets too, where the graph could in principle have been
 * mutated by an older version of the app:
 *
 * 1. The walk starts at the first `INPUT`-typed node (or the first node when
 *    no `INPUT` exists). If no nodes are present, the helper returns the
 *    placeholder `empty graph`.
 * 2. At each step the walker picks the **first outgoing connection** in
 *    declaration order — branches are dropped from the preview because the
 *    card has no room for a fan-out diagram, and the preview only needs to
 *    convey the rough shape.
 * 3. The walk stops when no outgoing connection exists, when the target
 *    node id is missing from `nodes`, or after at most [MAX_NODES] hops
 *    (cycle safety + UI-readable length cap).
