/**
 * Handles a background wakeup for a single trigger: load it, decide via the pure
 * [EvaluateTriggerFiringUseCase], and act.
 *
 * On [TriggerFiringDecision.Fire] it does **not** run inference itself — it
 * delegates to the existing [TaskScheduler.scheduleOneTime] path so the run goes
 * through `AgentWorker` exactly like a scheduled task (foreground promotion,
 * completion notification and engine unload all reused), attributed to
 * [RunOrigin.TRIGGER].
 *
 * **Bound session.** Unlike a scheduled task — which inherits the chat session
 * it was scheduled from — a trigger has no originating conversation, so it
 * lazily owns one. On the first fire (or after the user deletes the previously
 * bound session) it mints a chat session named after the trigger and threads it
 * to the scheduler, so the results of recurring fires accumulate in one
 * conversation instead of spawning a fresh session each time. The binding
 * ([TriggerRepository.setSessionId]) is persisted only **after** the enqueue
 * succeeds, so a failed fire never strands the trigger on an empty session. A
 * "Trigger fired" notification (best-effort) deep-links the user straight into
 * that session.
 *
 * Safety behaviours enforced here:
 * - **Idempotency.** The fire-state writes ([TriggerRepository.markFired] and,
 *   for event triggers, the disarm) happen **before** the irreversible enqueue,
 *   so a process death or DB error on the worker retry path re-evaluates against
 *   the recorded state and cannot enqueue a duplicate run (the cost of the rare
 *   failure is a *missed* run, not a doubled one). Session resolution happens
 *   **before** those writes, so a failure to create the session re-evaluates and
 *   fires fresh rather than burning the cycle; a freshly-minted session is rolled
 *   back if the enqueue itself then fails. The "Trigger fired" notification is
 *   posted best-effort so a notification failure cannot trigger a worker retry
 *   (which, past the completed enqueue, would double-schedule the run).
 * - **Edge firing.** Event conditions (charging / network) fire once per
 *   transition into the satisfied state; the disarm here plus the
 *   [TriggerFiringDecision.ReArm] path implement that latch.
 * - **Deleted bound pipeline.** Auto-disabled rather than firing into nothing.
 *
 * **Journal — no silent skips.** Every evaluated trigger writes exactly one
 * [app.knotwork.android.domain.models.TriggerEvaluation] recording its verdict,
 * atomically with the decision, via [recordTriggerEvaluation]. A skip records
 * [TriggerEvaluationVerdict.Skipped] with the reason, a re-arm records
 * [TriggerEvaluationVerdict.ReArmed] (making the consumed-on-fire → re-arm window
 * visible rather than a mystery), and a fire records [TriggerEvaluationVerdict.Fired]
 * with the run id **before** the run exists — so the run's terminal outcome is later
 * attributed straight back onto this row (see [triggerRunOutcomeForTerminal]). The
 * only evaluation that writes no row is [TriggerFireOutcome.NotFound]: the trigger
 * was deleted, so there is nothing to attribute a row to. Recording is best-effort
 * (the journal store absorbs and logs its own failures) and never alters or aborts
 * the fire it observes.
