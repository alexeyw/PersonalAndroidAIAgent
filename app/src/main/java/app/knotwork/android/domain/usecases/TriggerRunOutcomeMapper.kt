/**
 * Maps the terminal state of a background [PipelineRun][app.knotwork.android.domain.models.PipelineRun]
 * onto the [TriggerRunOutcome] recorded back onto the originating trigger-evaluation
 * journal row.
 *
 * This is the single translation from the run runtime's vocabulary
 * ([PipelineRunStatus] plus a typed [RunTerminationReason]) into the journal's
 * diagnostic vocabulary, so every consumer settling a run attributes the same
 * outcome for the same terminal state. It is a pure function — no I/O, no clock —
 * and so exhaustively unit-testable.
 *
 * **The classification reads the typed reason, not the error text.** Until the
 * reason existed this function recovered one distinction — an expired approval
 * window — by comparing the recorded message against a constant by string
 * equality. That worked only for as long as nobody edited the copy, and editing
 * that copy is planned work. A vocabulary is now a vocabulary; the message is
 * demoted to what it always was, a rendering for a person to read.
 *
 * The mapping deliberately keeps **platform** outcomes distinct from **product**,
 * **deliberate** and **protective** ones, which is the whole point of the
 * background-reliability journal:
 * - [PipelineRunStatus.COMPLETED] → [TriggerRunOutcome.Success].
 * - [PipelineRunStatus.FAILED] stopped by an autonomous-run ceiling
 *   ([RunTerminationKind.STEP_CEILING] / [RunTerminationKind.TOKEN_CEILING]) →
 *   [TriggerRunOutcome.StoppedByCeiling]. A safety limit doing its job is not a
 *   defect of the trigger, and reporting it as one would teach the user to
 *   distrust a health indicator that is telling the truth.
 * - [PipelineRunStatus.FAILED] carrying [RunTerminationKind.HITL_WINDOW_EXPIRED] →
 *   [TriggerRunOutcome.HitlTimeout]: the run did not fail on its own, it parked on
 *   an approval/clarification the user never answered in the window. Distinguished
 *   here from a genuine failure so the journal does not blame the pipeline for an
 *   un-answered prompt.
 * - Any other [PipelineRunStatus.FAILED] → [TriggerRunOutcome.Failure] with the
 *   error message (or a neutral fallback when none was recorded).
 * - [PipelineRunStatus.INTERRUPTED] → [TriggerRunOutcome.CancelledBySystem]: the
 *   owning process died mid-run and the startup sweep reaped the record — the
 *   platform-kill signal (OEM background killer / OOM). Never conflated with a
 *   [TriggerRunOutcome.Failure] or with a deliberate stop.
 * - [PipelineRunStatus.CANCELLED] → [TriggerRunOutcome.Cancelled]: a
 *   **deliberate** in-process stop (the user pressed Stop, or the hosting service
 *   was torn down). Its own contract is "the user cancelled the run — not a
 *   failure", so it must not be reported as a platform kill either.
 *
 * The terminal statuses are matched exhaustively (no `else`), so adding a future
 * terminal status is a compile error here rather than a silent mis-mapping; the
 * non-terminal branch is the single guard rejecting a misuse.
 *
 * @param status The terminal run status. Must satisfy [PipelineRunStatus.isTerminal];
 *   a non-terminal status is a caller bug and throws [IllegalArgumentException].
 * @param errorMessage The human-readable failure/interruption text recorded on the
 *   run, or `null`. Only used to fill [TriggerRunOutcome.Failure].
 * @param reason The typed cause when the app itself decided to end the run, or
 *   `null` for a completion or an ordinary node failure. Drives the classification.
 * @return The [TriggerRunOutcome] to attribute to the run's journal row.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if [status] is not terminal.

 * What the trigger journal says about a run the stuck-detector ended.
 *
 * A sentence and not the run's persisted message, because that message is the
 * detector's diagnostic (`no-progress`) — terse and greppable on purpose — and
 * the journal renders it to a person rather than to a log reader.
 *
 * **Byte-identical to `R.string.run_termination_body_no_progress`**, which is
 * what the chat tile and the background notification say about the same event.
 * A second wording here would have been the fork this whole vocabulary exists
 * to prevent: one stop, three sentences, depending on which surface the user
 * happened to look at. It is duplicated rather than shared because `domain`
 * cannot read string resources, and `RunTerminationCopyMapperTest` fails if the
 * two ever drift apart.
 *
 * The tidier shape — a typed `TriggerRunOutcome` variant like
 * `StoppedByCeiling`, letting the journal resolve its own copy from the kind —
 * is deliberately not taken here: it is a persisted journal vocabulary plus an
 * export schema bump, which is a wider change than this task opened. That shape
 * would also settle the one cost being accepted: a domain constant cannot be
 * translated, so when the planned `values-ru` pass lands the chat will speak
 * Russian about a stuck run while this journal row stays English.
