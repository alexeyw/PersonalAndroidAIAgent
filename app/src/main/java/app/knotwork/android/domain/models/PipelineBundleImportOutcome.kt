/**
 * Outcome of parsing a pipeline **bundle** JSON document — a self-contained
 * envelope that carries a root pipeline together with the transitive closure
 * of every sub-pipeline it references through `PIPELINE` nodes.
 *
 * The bundle format is a thin envelope over the single-pipeline schema owned
 * by [app.knotwork.android.domain.pipelineio.PipelineJsonSerializer]; each
 * element of the `pipelines` array is a full single-pipeline document. The
 * envelope adds referential-integrity guarantees the single format cannot: on
 * a clean parse, every `PIPELINE` node's `targetPipelineId` resolves to a
 * pipeline contained in the same file.
 *
 * Mirrors the three-variant shape of [PipelineImportOutcome], adapted for the
 * multi-pipeline case: a schema mismatch is reported per offending pipeline
 * and aggregated, so one out-of-version element does not mask the rest.
