/**
 * Repository over the two-tier pipeline-preset catalogue:
 *
 * - **Bundled presets** are read-only and ship inside the APK under
 *   `assets/presets/pipelines`. They form the curated starter catalogue
 *   surfaced on first launch.
 * - **User presets** are mutable and live in the `pipeline_presets` Room
 *   table (schema v24). They are created when the user runs
 *   `SavePipelineAsPresetUseCase` against the currently-edited graph.
 *
 * The split is intentional: bundled presets cannot be edited or deleted by
 * the user, which keeps the starter catalogue stable across sessions and
 * lets us ship updated copies via app updates. User presets are owned by
 * the user and freely mutable through this repository.
