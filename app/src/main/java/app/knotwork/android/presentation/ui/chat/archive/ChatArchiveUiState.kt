/**
 * One archived chat as the ViewModel models it — the presentation-layer twin of
 * the catalog `ChatArchiveRowUi`, holding the *bucket* rather than the
 * formatted label so the localisation stays in the composable.
 *
 * @property id session id.
 * @property title chat display name (already falling back to the default name).
 * @property archivedAt bucket describing how long ago the user archived it.
 * @property starred whether the chat is favorited.
 * @property ranAfterArchiving whether the session was written to *after* being
 *   archived — i.e. a background run settled while it was put away. Surfaced so
 *   a chat that changed on its own never looks like it did not.

 * @property rows archived chats, most-recently-archived first (the repository
 *   flow already orders them).
 * @property errorMessage read failure, or `null`. Non-null wins over
 *   [loading] and [rows] in the visual mapping.
