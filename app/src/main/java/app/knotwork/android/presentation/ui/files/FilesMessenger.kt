 * Its own class rather than a pair of ViewModel helpers for two reasons. The
 * outcome it reports is produced in two places — most failures inside
 * [FilesViewModel], but share staging inside `FilesScreen`, which performs the
 * staging itself because it needs a `Context` and a `FileProvider` — so a single
 * owner keeps the wording and the routing in one file. And the routing has a
 * rule worth stating once: these messages go to the activity-level
 * [TransientMessageRelay] rather than a screen-local host, because the host that
 * renders them lives above the NavGraph and a message therefore survives the
 * screen navigating away from under it.
 *
 * @property relay Activity-level one-shot snackbar bus.
 * @property context Application context, used only to resolve the copy.
