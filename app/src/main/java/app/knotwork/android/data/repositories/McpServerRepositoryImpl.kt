/**
 * Default [McpServerRepository] implementation.
 *
 * This class owns the Tools surface's **view** of a server — its TTL-cached tool
 * list and its observable connection status. It does **not** own the connection:
 * live clients belong to the shared [McpConnectionPool], which `ToolRepositoryImpl`
 * uses for the calls the agent actually makes. That sharing is the point. While
 * each repository kept its own pool, the health indicator described one session
 * and the agent used another, so the screen could read "13 tools · ok" against a
 * session that was already dead for execution purposes.
 *
 * The class is `@Singleton` so the same caches and status flows are reused across
 * every ViewModel observer. Concurrent `fetchToolList` calls for one server are
 * collapsed into a single round-trip by holding that server's pool lock across
 * the cache check and the fetch — two collectors subscribing at once on a cold
 * start would otherwise both connect, which is wasteful and races the status
 * emissions.
